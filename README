# Web Project

This is a simple web project consisting of an index page and three additional pages: Home, About, and My Projects. The project demonstrates basic HTML and CSS, as well as linking between different pages.

## Directory Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

## Files

- **index.html**: This is the main entry point of the website. It contains links to the Home, About, and My Projects pages.

- **home.html**: This file contains the content for the Home page. It includes links to the About and My Projects pages, as well as a link back to the index page.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Each page contains a navigation bar with links to the Home, About, and My Projects pages, as well as a link back to the index page.
